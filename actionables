-Login page
-Settings page
-Update sidebar (Settings and Logout on the bottom, GradeBoard text clickable)
-Update dashboard (sorted by urgency with colors, figure out what to do with archived assignments, make elements responsive to window resizing) 
-Update grading page - right “summary” sidebar or floaty bar thing (submitting grades)
-Redesign modal, different weighting for categories in rubric
-Add an affordance for urgency of assignment, 
-Some people liked the moving light on the assignment progress bar, some did not.
-Sorting the dashboard assignments by urgency will be confusing in terms of the colors used to represent them.
-Save/submit on the grading modal is the same color and should be differentiated.
-There should be a submission for all grades, not just one specific student's.
-It would be nice for a user to click a cell on the rubric table and the text would automatically paste itself into the feedback field.
-Use "you" in the rubric.
-The categories are not all out of 100, points are subjective to weight.
